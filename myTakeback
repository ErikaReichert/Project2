This class has been a great experience and without a doubt one of my favorite CS classes I have taken at Pitt.
Coming into this class I was concerned with how I'd do but I'm extremely satisfied with the outcome.
You have been a great professor and if I had more time, I'd take more of your classes.

As for my project, I tried to stay consistent with both of my parts.
Photography is a hobby of mine and creating this website has really got me to think.
I'm starting to think about actually pushing my website to the internet so that anyone can see it.
I think I might actually be able to make something out of my hobby.

Additionally, if I were to push my site I would have a lot more work to do.
First I'd have to go out and develop more photographs. That way I have more stuff to display on my site.
I'd also have to make it fully functioning by making sure all of my links work.
I'd also have to actually put in my real contact info on the contact page.
And lastly, I'd have to create social media pages that I can actually link to from my 'connect' page.

Thank you for such a great experience. I really enjoyed your class.
