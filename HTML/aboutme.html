    About Me
  </h2>
  <p class="aboutme">
    What started as required high school art credit has developed into an incredible passion.
    My passion for photography started at the age of 15 and has steadily continued to grow.
    Six years later and I'm starting to turn a dream into reality.
    I specialize in portraits but am always willing to expand.
    My goal is to capture what truely lies behind a model and
    not just their beauty but also their inner strength and passion.
